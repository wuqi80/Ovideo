# Contributing to Ostory TV

## Before coding

1. Describe the affected workflow and its persisted state.
2. Identify API, task, billing, notification, provider, and worker consumers.
3. Confirm whether historical rows or in-flight tasks need compatibility.
4. Add a focused regression test before changing a shared contract.

## Architecture rules

- Keep provider model identifiers behind capability and runtime configuration
  services. User-facing components consume stable public model keys and labels.
- Treat candidate creation and candidate selection as separate operations.
- Resolve current content bindings at submission time; do not cache mutable asset
  URLs inside long-lived UI state.
- Propagate staleness narrowly. Never delete downstream outputs or regenerate
  billable content without an explicit user action.
- Attach asynchronous results by lineage and never replace a newer user choice.
- Compatibility modules may import and re-export canonical implementations, but
  new code must import the canonical module directly.

## Comment standard

Useful comments explain why a rule exists, what data invariant is protected, or
how a future implementation may be extended. Avoid dates, ticket numbers,
migration-source names, and descriptions of code that are obvious from the code
itself. Public functions that coordinate persistence or billing should document:

- inputs and ownership;
- idempotency or retry behavior;
- success/failure side effects;
- compatibility assumptions.

## Verification

Run focused tests first, then the broader affected suites. Changes to frontend,
routes, persistence, or public contracts also require the production build,
route contract, open-source hygiene check, and `git diff --check`.

Never commit real credentials, local databases, generated media, production
backups, or internal deployment reports.
